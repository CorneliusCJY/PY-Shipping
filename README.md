# Shipping

# Instructions:

1. First things first, define a weight variable and set it equal to any number.

2. Next, we need to know how much it costs to ship a package of given weight by normal 
   ground shipping based on the “Ground shipping” table above.

   Write a comment that says “Ground Shipping”.

    Create an if/elif/else statement for the cost of ground shipping. It should check 
    for weight, and print the cost of shipping a package of that weight.

3. A package that weighs 8.4 pounds should cost $53.60 to ship with normal ground shipping:

    8.4\ lb \times \$4.00 + \$20.00 = \$53.608.4 lb×$4.00+$20.00=$53.60
    Test that your ground shipping function gets the same value.

4. We’ll also need to make sure we include the price of premium ground shipping in our code.

    Create a variable for the cost of premium ground shipping.

    Note: This does not need to be an if statement because the price of premium ground 
    shipping does not change with the weight of the package.

5. Print it out for the user just in case they forgot!

6. Write a comment for this section of the code, “Drone Shipping”.

    Create an if/elif/else statement for the cost of drone shipping. 
    This statement should check against weight and print the cost of 
    shipping a package of that weight.

7. A package that weighs 1.5 pounds should cost $6.75 to ship by drone:

   1.5\ lb \times \$4.50 + \$0.00 = \$6.751.5 lb×$4.50+$0.00=$6.75
   Test that your drone shipping function gets the same value.

8. Now, test everything one more time!

    What is the cheapest method of shipping a 4.8 pound package 
    and how much would it cost?
    What is the cheapest method of shipping a 41.5 pound package 
    and how much would it cost?
